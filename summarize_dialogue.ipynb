        "## Token Limits: Keeping It Short & Snappy\n",
        "So, when we cranked down `max_new_tokens` to 10, the outputs got way shorter! It might look like it's chopping off stuff at first, but honestly, it made things super concise and right on target. Like, take this example: “#Person1 wants to upgrade his system.” It's brief, but it totally captures the main vibe of the chat. Cool, right? 💡  \n",
        "\n",
        "The big takeaway? Capping tokens can give you those tight, focused summaries, though you might miss out on some subtle bits.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Going Probabilistic with Sampling 🎲\n",
        "Flipping on `do_sample=True` changes the game from straight-up predictable (always grabbing the top word) to more random, picking from a bunch of options. The `temperature` knob dials in how crazy or chill it gets:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Low temp (say 0.1)**: Pretty much sticks to the safe, expected stuff – like the no-sampling version.\n",
        "- **Mid temp (around 0.5)**: Hits that sweet spot, giving you variety without going off the rails. Feels real natural, like how a person might sum it up. 😊\n",
        "- **High temp (1.0 or more)**: Gets all creative and wild, but sometimes veers away from the point. For example, you might get something like “#Person1 thinks upgrading software will make it more appealing to customers” – neat idea, but not quite the summary we need. 🚀\n",
        "\n",
        "Science bit: Bumping up temperature evens out the odds on words, so less obvious ones sneak in more, adding flair but upping the chance of weirdness.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Finding the Balance ⚖️\n",
        "That 0.5 temp really nailed it – summaries were fresh but still spot-on, nailing both the software and hardware upgrade angles from the convo. Best setup we found:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "generation_config = GenerationConfig(max_new_tokens=50, do_sample=True, temperature=0.5)\n",

        "## Wrapping It Up 🎉\n",
        "- Super low token caps (like 10) make for sharp, bite-sized summaries that feel like quick human notes, but they can skim on depth.\n",
        "- Letting in more tokens (50-ish) gives room for smoother, fuller ones.\n",
        "- Moderate sampling at 0.5? That's the winner – creative enough but keeps it accurate and on point! 🌈"
